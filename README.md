## ✨ About the Project

This calculator is designed to handle basic arithmetic operations with a modern UI and responsive layout.  
It provides real-time input handling and ensures a smooth interaction without page reloads.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my **JavaScript logic**, **DOM manipulation**, and **UI styling skills** while building something practical and user-friendly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure of the calculator  
- **CSS** – Styling, layout, gradients, and button effects  
- **JavaScript** – Logic, event handling, and calculations

## 🔄 Development Process

1. Created the calculator layout using **HTML buttons and input field**  
2. Styled the UI using **CSS gradients, shadows, and rounded buttons**  
3. Selected all buttons using JavaScript and added **click event listeners**  
4. Used a string-based approach to store user input  
5. Implemented:
   - `eval()` for calculation
   - Try–catch for error handling
   - Conditions for AC and DEL buttons
6. Prevented invalid inputs like double operators  

This step-by-step approach helped keep the logic simple and easy to manage.
